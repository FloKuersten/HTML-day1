    <div>
      Html But you’re not alone, and you’re not discreet JavaScript But as for
      me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone

    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <div>
      PHP Never really did ever quite get that… Yes Make some coffee, hold me up
    </div>

    <h3>Verse Two</h3>

    <div>
      Life 7:30 Friday evening Like coding in word The safest place to hide
